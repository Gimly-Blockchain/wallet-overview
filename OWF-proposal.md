# Project Name
SSI Wallet Overview

# Project Description
Further developing and maintaining the SSI Wallet Overview and making a similar overview for SSI agents/SDKs.

Currently, there is a large variety of digital wallets available, each working technically differently and achieving different privacy, security and user-friendliness properties. TNO has developed a [SSI Wallet Overview](https://tno-ssi-lab.github.io/wallet-overview/), that, for each wallet, gives insight into its characteristics, filled in by its developer. This work was presented at DICE 2023, where multiple experts showed their interested, including FindyFi, who is now an active contributor. 

The goal of these overviews is to help users of digital identity to make a choice in wallet, based on their preference in characteristics. It also offers insight into which wallets work in a similar fashion.

No technical dependencies have been identified.
However, we want the contents of the overview as accurate and as up-to-date as possible, which requires the collaboration of wallet vendors. So far, already 22 wallet vendors have collaborated by either filling in the [Google Form](https://forms.gle/SxhZZ5aHnwgRhnnH9) or via pull requests.
